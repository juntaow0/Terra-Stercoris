    sentence: Oh it was the soul! Some people called it the spirit too right. Man
      I'm so jealous! I wanna see Earth so bad. I really need to ask for a department

    sentence: "I\u2019ll set my cryopod to wake me when you land, so make sure you

    sentence: "...I mean I can only imagine the type of apex predators that had to

    sentence: "You clink glasses together with John and drink, although with a bit
      more uneasiness in your mind. That\u2019s all you remember, it\u2019s all a
